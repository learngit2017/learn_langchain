Save changes by clicking on  the Save  button at the bottom of the page.   \\n8.1.1.1  Change Email Address  \\nIn order to change an email address , the user  will be required to enter and confirm the new email address before this will \\nbe changed. An email will be sent to the new email address to verify that the change is correct. An email confirming the \\nchange will also be sent to the old email address.  \\n8.1.2 Change Password  \\nTo chang e your login password go to the Update Details  page. Scroll down to the Reset Password section and enter the current password and the \\nnew password. Please remember to click Save  after the new password  has been entered .  \\nIf you have forgotten your password and cannot log in, go to the Login  page and hit the “Reset Password” link.

You can change this zone by creating another zone at that  \\npoint or selected one of the other nearby zone (if any exist).  \\n8.1.3.2  Minimum Trip Time  \\nAny trips sho rter than this time period will not appear in the trip list. This could be caused by switching the car’s ignition on \\nand then immediately off again.  \\n8.1.3.3  Minimum Trip Distance  \\nAny trips shorter than this distance will not appear in the trip list.  \\n8.1.3.4  Nearby Zone Metres  \\nAny zone that falls within this  distance of a trip start or end point is considered a nearby zone. Only nearby zones are \\nshown as alternatives to snapped zones when editing a trip.  \\n8.1.4 Personal Selection  \\nThere are three additional preferences  that can b e updated . These include the following : \\n8.1.4.1  Receive Reminders  \\nWhen selected , a notification email will be sent when the recommended time limit for uploading data has expired . \\n8.1.4.2  Receive Newsletters  \\nWhen selected , the GPS Logbook  newsletter will be emailed to th e email address in the account.
